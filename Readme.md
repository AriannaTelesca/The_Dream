# THE DREAM PROJET  

## The Mission

1. Pick your next travel destination and check the exchange rate: local currency / Euros.
2. Make a small webpage where you can enter the local rate (use a form), and it'll tell you the price in Euros. A simple calculation will do, no need to get updated rates from external API's.
3. Use a form that submits to PHP (no JS allowed / no preventDefault)

### Nice to haves

- Allow the user to choose between different currencies
- Provide a button to switch the from / to valuta types (So Euro -> Dollar becomes Dollar --> Euro)
